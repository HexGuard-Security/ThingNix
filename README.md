## Overview

ThingNix is a specialized NixOS distribution designed for security researchers, penetration testers, and hobbyists who work with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, embedded systems, and RF communications. It provides a declarative, reproducible environment with pre-configured tools for firmware analysis, radio frequency investigation, and hardware exploitation.

Part of the future "NixCraft" series for specialized pentesting domains.

## Key Features

- **Reproducible Environments**: Built on NixOS with Nix Flakes for consistent, declarative configurations
- **Atomic Updates**: Safe system upgrades with rollback capability
- **Pre-configured Hardware Support**: Ready-to-use drivers and udev rules for common pentesting hardware
- **Specialized Tooling**: Curated collection of tools for IoT security research
- **Community-Driven**: Open to contributions and tool suggestions

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

To build and use ThingNix:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HexGuard-Security/ThingNix.git
   cd ThingNix
   ```

2. Build the ISO using the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. Flash the ISO to a USB drive:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=build/thingnix-0.1.0-alpha-x86_64_linux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
   ```

4. Boot from the USB drive and start hacking!

### System Requirements

- **Minimal**: 2GB RAM, dual-core CPU, 20GB storage
- **Recommended**: 8GB+ RAM, quad-core CPU, 50GB+ SSD, compatible SDR hardware

### Supported Architectures

- x86_64 (primary)
- aarch64 (experimental)

## Building the ISO

ThingNix uses Nix Flakes to create reproducible builds. The build process varies depending on your host system:

### On Linux

If you're running Linux, you can build ThingNix directly:

```bash
# Make sure you have Nix installed with flakes enabled
nix-shell -p nixos-generators git

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/HexGuard-Security/ThingNix.git
cd ThingNix
./build.sh
```

### On macOS

Building NixOS-based systems on macOS requires additional steps. We've provided detailed instructions in [docs/BUILD-ON-MAC.md](docs/BUILD-ON-MAC.md).

In short, you'll need to:
1. Set up a Linux VM or container environment
2. Build the ISO inside that environment
3. Transfer the ISO back to your host system

### On Windows

Building on Windows requires WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with a Linux distribution that supports Nix. Follow the Linux instructions after setting up your WSL environment.

## Become a Tester

**We need your help!** ThingNix is currently in alpha and we're looking for testers to help improve it before the official release. As a tester, you'll:

- Build and try out pre-release versions of ThingNix
- Test compatibility with various hardware devices
- Report bugs and provide feedback
- Help improve documentation
- Suggest features and improvements

**To become a tester:**

1. Star and watch this repository for updates
2. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/thingnix) to connect with other testers
3. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/HexGuard-Security/ThingNix/issues) page for known issues and testing tasks
4. Report your findings by creating new issues with the "testing" label

We particularly need testers with:
- Various SDR hardware (RTL-SDR, HackRF, LimeSDR, etc.)
- IoT development boards
- JTAG/SWD debugging hardware
- Zigbee/BLE sniffers

## Tool Inventory

ThingNix comes with a comprehensive suite of pre-installed security tools. For a complete list, see [TOOLS.md](docs/TOOLS.md).

If you need a tool that isn't included, check our documentation on [adding custom packages](docs/custom-packages.md).

## Hardware Compatibility

ThingNix is designed to work with common IoT pentesting hardware:

- SDR receivers (RTL-SDR, HackRF, etc.)
- JTAG/SWD debuggers
- Flash programmers (CH341A, etc.)
- Zigbee/BLE sniffers

See [HARDWARE.md](docs/HARDWARE.md) for detailed compatibility information.

## Customization

ThingNix is designed to be customizable. You can:

- Replace the default wallpaper by editing `assets/wallpapers/thingnix-wallpaper.png`
- Use one of the included themes or create your own in `assets/themes/`
- Customize the icon set in `assets/icons/`

For more detailed customization instructions, see [CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md).

## Building

# Build a minimal ISO with the current config
./build.sh
```

For more advanced build options:

```bash
# Build for a specific architecture
./build.sh --arch aarch64-linux

# Clean before building
./build.sh --clean

# Get help on build options
./build.sh --help
```
